# TypeScript Components by Rupert

This component was created during a CESI School of Engineering Project for a food delivery website named GamblEats.

## Getting Started

Install this package :

```shell
npm add flat-search-bar-by-gambleats
```

Import the SearchBar component :

```js
import { SearchBar } from "flat-search-bar-by-gambleats";
```

You can then render the `SearchBar` component like any other React component in JSX.
